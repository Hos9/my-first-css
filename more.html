      Coxs Bazar is one of the most beautiful and refreshing places I have ever
      visited in Bangladesh. As soon as I arrived, the fresh sea breeze and the
      sound of waves made me forget all my tiredness. The long sandy beach—the
      longest natural sea beach in the world—looks absolutely stunning,
      especially during sunrise and sunset.

      Walking along the beach early in the morning was my favorite part. The sky
      slowly changing colors, fishermen returning with their nets, and gentle
      waves touching my feet created a peaceful feeling. In the evening, the
      beach becomes lively with tourists, street food stalls, and local shops
      selling shells and handicrafts.

      I also visited Himchari, where green hills meet the sea, and Inani Beach,
      which is quieter and famous for its coral stones and clear water. The view
      there was breathtaking. Another memorable experience was watching the
      sunset from Laboni Beach—the golden sunlight reflecting on the sea was
      magical.

      Seafood in Coxs Bazar is a must-try. Fresh grilled fish, shrimp, and local
      dishes tasted amazing. The hospitality of the local people was warm and
      welcoming, which made the trip even more enjoyable.
    </p>

    <p class="extrenal">
      Overall, my trip to Coxs Bazar was relaxing, fun, and full of beautiful
      memories. It is a perfect place for nature lovers, families, and anyone
      who wants a break from busy city life. I would love to visit again
      someday.
